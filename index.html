<p>Hi, I'm Paulo KÃ¶ch. I'm a software engineer, and I live in Porto, Portugal.</p>
<p> My personal web presence is probably best described at <a href="https://keybase.io/pkoch">keybase.io</a>. My email is first name, period, last name (no diacritics), at gmail.com.</p>

<p>For my professional info, check out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pkoch/">my LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>There was a blog here, but I got tired of updating it and not writing enough. You can use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://pko.ch/">the Internet Archive</a> if you want to check it out.</p>
